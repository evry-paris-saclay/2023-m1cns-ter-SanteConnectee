When diagnosing a Myocardial Infarction (MI), various ECG changes must be considered.
The ST segment elevation is a critical indicator that signals myocardial injury. For instance, if the ST elevation is observed in leads II, III, and aVF, an inferior MI is suggested, whereas ST elevation in leads V2 to V4 points to an anterior MI. Additionally, ST depressions opposite the infarct area, known as reciprocal changes, are also significant. T wave abnormalities are another aspect, where inverted or sharply peaked ”tombstone” T waves can be seen in the affected leads. Lastly, the presence of Q waves, which are pathological, indicates a transmural MI and will appear in the corresponding leads of the infarct area.
Conduction disturbances in the heart manifest through various changes in the ECG. A QRS complex that is wider than 0.12 seconds is indicative of a disturbance. Specifically, an RSR’ or rSR’ pattern in lead V1 suggests a right bundle branch block (RBBB), whereas a wide S wave or notched R wave in lead V6 indicates a left bundle branch block (LBBB). In lead III, multiple peaked QRS complexes may show localized intraventricular conduction delays. Additionally, a QRS complex wider than 0.12 seconds without the specific characteristics of LBBB or RBBB points to a generalized intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD).
Hypertrophy within the heart can be detected by assessing certain ECG features. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is characterized by tall R waves in leads I and V5-V6, coupled with deep S waves in V1-V2. A sum greater than 35 mm of the S wave depth in V2 and the R wave height in V5 is indicative of LVH. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) is suggested by increased R wave amplitude in V1 and a deep S wave in V6, with an R:S ratio greater than 1 in V1. Atrial enlargement is also identifiable; left atrial enlargement shows as a broad and notched P wave in lead II (P-mitrale), while right atrial enlargement presents as a tall and peaked P wave in the same lead (P-pulmonale).
(Only when there is no other diagnosable arrhythmia.) STTC is only significant when there is no other arrhythmia types, otherwise, abnormalities are diagnostic rather than STTC. Analyzing ST/T changes on an ECG requires a lookout for any obvious abnormalities. For example, wide and bizarre complexes interspersed with normal cycles may hint at ventricular tachycardia. ST depression and T waves that deviate from the normal direction are indicative of ischemia. ST elevation, which may or may not be accompanied by changes in T waves, denotes injury. The presence of pathological Q waves, especially in leads other than V1, is significant.
Moreover, symmetrical or asymmetrical changes in the ST segment and T waves provide in- sights into the underlying pathology. Clear signs of ischemia or infarction are regional T wave abnormalities, ST segment changes, and the appearance of Q waves.
